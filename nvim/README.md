### My Neovim Configuration

To try out my Neovim configuration, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/arpan404/arpan404.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the linker directory:**
    ```sh
    cd arpan404/link
    ```

3. **Run the linker:**
    ```sh
    go run main.go
    ```

This will link the configuration to your Neovim setup.

**Note:** This linker is designed for Linux and macOS. It has not been tested on Windows. If you encounter issues on Windows, please link the configuration manually.
